    description: >
      A tool for querying BigQuery datasets. The user will provide a full SQL query.
      For example, to find the top 5 most expensive products from the TheLook eCommerce dataset,
      the query would be:
      "SELECT name, retail_price FROM `bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce.products` ORDER BY retail_price DESC LIMIT 5"
    # No specific parameters are needed here as the tool takes the query directly.
    # The service account used by your Cloud Run service will handle authentication.
